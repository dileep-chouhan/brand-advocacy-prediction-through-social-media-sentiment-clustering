# Brand Advocacy Prediction through Social Media Sentiment Clustering

## Overview

This project analyzes social media conversations surrounding a brand to identify key sentiment clusters and predict the likelihood of users becoming brand advocates.  The analysis leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to categorize user sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) and incorporates engagement metrics to build a predictive model.  The output provides insights into the dominant sentiments expressed towards the brand and identifies user segments most likely to become brand advocates.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* NLTK (or spaCy - specify which is used)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   *Note:*  The script may require you to provide input data in a specific format (specify the format if applicable, e.g., CSV file).  Details on data input can be found in the `data` folder or in a separate documentation file (if one exists).

## Example Output

The script will print a summary of the sentiment analysis to the console, including statistics on the distribution of sentiments and the performance of the predictive model.  Additionally, the following output files will be generated in the `output` directory:

* **`sentiment_distribution.png`**: A bar chart visualizing the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
* **`advocacy_prediction_model.pkl`**: (Optional) A saved model file for future predictions.  This will only be generated if the model training is successful and the project includes model saving.
* **Other plots:** (List any other generated plots and briefly describe them)
